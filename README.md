- **Real-time Preview**: See your mixed color update instantly as you adjust sliders
- **Additive Color Mixing**: Advanced color mixing algorithm using LAB color space for accurate results
- **Help System**: Get the optimal solution with the "Help" button to learn color mixing techniques
- **Time Tracking**: Monitor how long you spend on each challenge
- **Advanced Color Comparison**: Uses CIEDE2000 algorithm for perceptually accurate color difference measurement
- **Smart Hints**: Receive helpful suggestions to improve your mix
- **History Tracking**: View your mixing attempts with match percentages and time taken
- **New Challenges**: Generate random target colors for endless practice
- **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on desktop and mobile devices

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files**

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action!

## üéØ How to Play

1. **Study the Target**: Look at the target color on the left side
2. **Mix Colors**: Use the sliders to adjust the percentage of each available color
3. **Watch the Preview**: Your mixed color updates in real-time on the right
4. **Click "Mix Colors!"**: Submit your attempt and see how well you matched
5. **Get Feedback**: Review your percentage match, DeltaE score, time taken, and helpful hints
6. **Use Help**: Click the "Help" button to see the optimal solution and learn techniques
7. **Try Again**: Use the feedback to improve your mix, or start a new challenge

## üé® Color Mixing System

### Dynamic Color Palette
The app intelligently selects 3 colors from a palette of 9 base colors:
- **Primary Colors**: Red, Yellow, Blue
- **Secondary Colors**: Green, Purple, Orange
- **Shading Colors**: White, Black

### Color Selection Logic
- **Teal/Cyan** (150-210¬∞): Blue + Green + one additional color
- **Purple** (240-300¬∞): Red + Blue + one additional color  
- **Red-Orange** (0-60¬∞): Red + Orange + one additional color
- **Yellow-Green** (60-120¬∞): Yellow + Green + one additional color
- **Blue** (210-240¬∞): Blue + Green + one additional color
- **Magenta** (300-360¬∞): Red + Purple + one additional color

### Mixing Algorithm
- **Additive Mixing**: Starts from black and adds color components
- **LAB Color Space**: Uses perceptually uniform color space for accurate mixing
- **CIEDE2000**: Advanced color difference calculation for precise matching

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Built With
- **React 18** - Modern React with hooks
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Canvas API** - For color previews and calculations
- **Advanced Color Algorithms** - LAB color space and CIEDE2000

### Key Components
- `App.js` - Main application component with timer and state management
- `ColorSlider.js` - Interactive slider for color adjustment
- `ColorSwatch.js` - Color preview display
- `ResultDisplay.js` - Results, feedback, and time display
- `HistoryPanel.js` - Mixing history with time tracking
- `HelpModal.js` - Optimal solution display and learning tool
- `colorUtils.js` - Advanced color mixing and comparison algorithms

### Color Space Conversions
The app uses multiple color spaces for optimal results:
- **RGB**: Standard digital color representation
- **XYZ**: Intermediate color space for conversions
- **LAB (CIELAB)**: Perceptually uniform color space for accurate mixing
- **HSL**: Used for hue-based color classification

### Optimization Algorithm
The help system uses a two-phase search:
1. **Coarse Search**: Quick exploration of color combinations
2. **Fine-tuning**: Precise optimization for best match

## üì± Responsive Design

The app is fully responsive and works on:
- Desktop computers
- Tablets
- Mobile phones
- All modern browsers

## üé® Learning Features

### Help System
- **Optimal Solution**: Shows the best possible color combination
- **Color Breakdown**: Displays exact percentages for each color
- **Mixing Instructions**: Step-by-step guide for achieving the target
- **Color Theory Tips**: Educational content about color mixing

### Feedback System
- **Match Percentage**: How close your mix is to the target
- **DeltaE Score**: Perceptually accurate color difference measurement
- **Time Tracking**: Monitor your improvement over time
- **Smart Hints**: Contextual suggestions based on your mix
